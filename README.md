# Philosofers

#### A 42 school project about multithreading

The objective was to create a program that would spawn philosophers around a table. 
All the philosophers have to eat, sleep and think. 
Their actions should not overlap. 
If a philosopher fails to eat on time he dies of hunger, when a philosopher dies the program ends. 
Time is counted and displayed in milliseconds.
